I mostly just make infinite side projects while waiting for a perfect moment that may or may not come.

My handle everywhere is **@Zedorfska**, feel free to contact me over ~~Discord~~ (soon to be Matrix).


So far I've mostly written stuff in:
 - Python
   - [Discord Bot](https://github.com/Zedorfska/Trowel)
 - GDScript
   - [Final for my high school](https://github.com/Zedorfska/CardGame)
   - [WarioWare game shuffler](https://github.com/Istaknuca-u-Povijesti-Betona/BetonWare)
 - C#
   - [RTS game in Godot](https://github.com/Istaknuca-u-Povijesti-Betona/RTS)

Aside code I also do music, modelling and the like...
